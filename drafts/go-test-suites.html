      <h1>Golang Test Suites</h1>
      <p>Sep 18, 2023</p>
      <p>
        Over the course of my career it's become increasingly evident that it's
        nearly impossible to have a test suite for a monolith that runs
        efficiently, reliably, and frequently. Between physical hardware
        requirements, race conditions in your application, and competing
        priorities, I find it incredibly difficult to maintain a reliable test
        suite that can provide useful signal to engineers continually shipping
        changes to an application.
      </p>
      <p>
        That brings us to my current predicament. I am currently working on a
        golang application (specifically go v1.18, this is important), and am
        finding it difficult getting the team to rally behind fixing tests that
        sporadically fail. Our hardware limitations are pretty set in stone, so
        the primary levers we have to pull are either fix the tests, or change
        the infrastructure to accomodate for these flaky tests. While I believe
        the former is preferable, this will be discussing how to address the
        latter in a golang environment.
      </p>
      <h2>Build Flags</h2>
      <p>
        When I was first starting to look into this, I was pretty sure that
        <code>go test</code>
        had the ability to filter what tests to run by a file regex. Turns out,
        although it has a decently robust API, it does not. Moreso, the only way
        to run a specific test is by specifying the actual test name! In case
        you are unfamiliar with how go tests are writte, you define a test by
        declaring some function like:
      </p>
      <pre><code>function TestAddNumbers(t *testing.T) {...</code></pre>
      <p>
        You would have to run <code>go test -run TestAddNumbers</code> in order
        to target running only this test. Now, let's say you have a bunch of
        integration tests that are testing your web layer. Those kinds of tests
        are super useful, but unfortunately in our case also a little
        unreliable. My first gut instinct is to split these tests out into their
        own test suite, run them on their own, maybe enable some retry logic at
        a high level, etc. That's where build flags come in.
      </p>
      <p>
        In go, when you run <code>go test</code>, it has to build your test
        suite before running your tests. This has the unfortunate side effect fo
        not being able to specify which files you want to run after the fact and
        in its stead, you have to tell the compiler which specific files to
        include at build time. Let's take an example:
      </p>
      <pre><code>function TestAddNumbers(t *testing.T) {
  expect.Equal(1 + 1, 2)
}</code></pre>
      <pre><code>function TestSubtractNumbers(t *testing.T) {
  expect.Equal(1 - 1, 0)
}</code></pre>
      <pre><code>function TestUnreliableThing(t *testing.T) {
  expect.Equal(...)
}</code></pre>
      <p>
        We specifically want to run <code>TestAddNumbers</code> and
        <code>TestSubtractNumbers</code>, and omit
        <code>TestUnreliableThing</code>, while we could manually provide all of
        the names of the tests to <code>-run</code> and <code>-skip</code>, this
        is both cumbersome and also completely unscalable. In order to achieve
        this, I've found the best way is with build flags. In order to do this,
        you can change the tests to something like:
      </p>
      <pre><code>// +build unit

function TestAddNumbers(t *testing.T) {
  expect.Equal(1 + 1, 2)
}</code></pre>
      <pre><code>// +build unit

function TestSubtractNumbers(t *testing.T) {
  expect.Equal(1 - 1, 0)
}</code></pre>
      <pre><code>// +build integration

function TestUnreliableThing(t *testing.T) {
  expect.Equal(...)
}</code></pre>
      <p>
        These flags allow us to run our go tests with
        <code>go test -tags unit</code> or
        <code>go test -tags integration</code>, and only the correspondingly
        tagged files will run. That's it! Some caveats here, you have to make
        sure your build flag is the very first line of the file, and it has to
        be followed by a newline otherwise the go compiler will think it's a
        normal comment.
