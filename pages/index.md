To whom this may concern,

Hello, I'm Kyle. Nice to meet you.

This is my website. I probably don't contribute to it as much as I should,
but I hope you enjoy it.

I'll be using this as a bit of a dumping ground for blog posts, trying out
some css, maybe a bit of a portfolio, who knows.

I hope you have a good day, thanks for visiting. Feel free to reach out to me
on any of my socials (linked below) if you wanna chat.

<div>Cheers,</div>
