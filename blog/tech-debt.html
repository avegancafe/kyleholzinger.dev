        Tech debt is one of the most popular buzz words in the industry (behind
        "sizzle"). And surprisingly, it even extends beyond just engineering--
        it frequently comes up in conversation with product managers,
        executives, sales, etc. So if it's so important that I have to talk
        about it when discussing projects with a CEO, then why does its
        definition feel so unclear?

      <h3>TL;DR</h3>

      <p>
        Technical debt is a class of code defect that indicates that a feature
        was avoided due to its implementation being time-intensive. While this
        seems like it can be the reason for not implementing a lot of things,
        there is a distinct difference between de-scoping a feature because it's
        not really needed at the time, and a feature being avoided specifically
        because it would take a long time despite the desire to do it now.
        Technical debt is an inherently contentious decision. This "long time"
        measure is more of a feeling than a specific amount of time, but it's
        one of those things that you know it when you see it.
