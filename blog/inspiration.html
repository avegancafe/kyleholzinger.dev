    <p><i>What motivates you?</i></p>
    <p>
      Inspiration is what gets you up in the morning. It’s that feeling where
      you can’t wait to pound out those <code>.apply</code>’s and write that
      chrome extension you’ve been meaning to finish. What gets you through the
      day?

      Recently after finishing a major in Computer Science, I’ve been thinking a
      lot about how I should spend my time, and why I do what I do (that being
      mainly web development these days). Although I finished my major fall
      semester, I still had one last class before graduating, so I decided to
      try to work throughout the semester instead of taking it easy. Though my
      friends may argue that my sitting around in sweats crushing some carefully
      crafted CoffeeScript and getting to work with some truly incredible people
      may be a walk in the park compared to their once-every-other-week problem
      sets, it was different than anything I’ve ever experienced. There were no
      rules, everyone was watching your every semicolon (but not really because
      CoffeeScript), and more importantly we were all working together. It might
      sound strange, but you’ve never felt the pain of working on a team until
      you’ve done a <code>git merge master</code>, run <code>git status</code>,
      and seen more red than Freddie Krueger on Elm Street. After a while I got
      into the rhythm, writing specs for features and bugs, and throwing
      together angular directives with JST templates, and it started making a
      little more sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      But why was I doing it? Obviously there’s the axiomatic generalization
      that it’s my job, but, I had to ask myself, why did I pick this job? Was
      it because I was comfortable with front-end development? Or maybe because
      I’m not fit for a role in algorithms development, as it’s been deemed by
      previous potential employers (cough all of silicon valley cough). After I
      thought about it for a bit, all the while still working and chatting with
      my co-workers over slack or reviewing PR’s on GitHub, I came to realize
      that it’s not the money, it’s not the work, and it’s not even my wonderful
      peers– it’s the chance to make a difference, and to sculpt the virtual
      landscape of our future. It may seem overtly self-centered and egocentric,
      but I dare say you have to be.

      After all, what else wakes you up more than the satisfaction of the
      noumenon and anticipation of what lies in store for tomorrow

    <script>
      var red = document.querySelector('.crt')

      function setProperty(duration) {
        red.style.setProperty('--animation-time', duration + 's')
      }

      function changeAnimationTime() {
        var animationDuration = (Math.random() + 1.5)
        setProperty(animationDuration)
      }

      setInterval(changeAnimationTime, 1000)
    </script>
